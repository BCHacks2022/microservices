For example, when you share a post or send a message to specific friends or accounts, they can download, screenshot, or reshare that content to others across or off our Products, in person or in virtual reality experiences such as Horizon Worlds------
Also, when you comment on someone else's post or react to their content, your comment or reaction is visible to anyone who can see the other person's content, and that person can change the audience later------
People can also use our Products to create and share content about you with the audience they choose------

where we have not developed our own first-party apps) will have access to all information you choose to share with them, including information your friends share with you, so they can provide our core functionality to you------
Note: We are in the process of restricting developers’ data access even further to help prevent abuse------p
For example, we will remove developers' access to your Facebook and Instagram data if you haven't used their app in 3 months, and we are changing Login, so that in the next version, we will reduce the data that an app can request without app review to include only name, Instagram username and bio, profile photo and email address------p
Requesting any other data will require our approval------
New owner------
If the ownership or control of all or part of our Products or their assets changes, we may transfer your information to the new owner------

  V------
How can I manage or delete information about me? We provide you with the ability to access, rectify, port and erase your data------
Learn more in your Facebook Settings and Instagram Settings------
We store data until it is no longer necessary to provide our services and Meta Products, or until your account is deleted - whichever comes first------p
This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs------
For example, when you search for something on Facebook, you can access and delete that query from within your search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months------
